So, what's static actually means. The word static means constant or the thing that doesn't change frequently. The static site renders the same content on the browser as it's already pre-rendered (backed). Static sites have fast page load speed and less dependent on the database unless of dynamic content. We need to decide when the website would behave static or dynamic?
