<mark>Are you tired of website performance?</mark>

**1 in 4** visitors would abandon the website if it takes more than 4 seconds to load. Slow website performance impacts rankings in search engines.

JAMstack is the modern way to build websites that delivers better performance. It provides the following benefits as below:

1. Better Performance
2. Higher Security
3. Cheaper, Easier Scaling
4. Better Developer Experience

As a developer, I was confused about what tech stack works best for my website when I was starting out. To develop the modern website, we have to manage different services as mention below:

- Front-end
- Back-end (server)
- Database (API)

We can build a tech stack to manage all the above services. That's where we can leverage the power of JAMstack. The benefit of JAMstack is that the front-end decoupled from the back-end, which makes the website better performance and a good developer experience.

Below you can visualize the stack covered in this course.
