The static website generates the content on the browser without any modification/processing as it's already pre-rendered. That's why static websites have  **better performance for page speed load**. We cover the project infrastracture to develop, build, and deploy website on the web. We use *Gatsby* infrastructure for building blazzing fast static website, project hosted on *GitHub* for version control and deploy on *Netlify*.

That's not it... This book is not only learning about specific tool but provides you the concepts to manage the project infracture to build website. We explaing how to use Git in you project for version control and manage project section with Git branches. You can avoid writing messy code with *prettier* and *ESlint*.

## A Short history

In past, website were deployed in monolithic fashion which means all the *services* that run the website lives on same server. *Services* includes front-end, back-end / Database. That's means if the server is down all the services will be down.

So, let's take another approch (Microservices).... In microservices, all the services runs on different server. If one of the server is down, it will not effect other services. We can easily find bug as we have to check only specific portion on server. This also helps to boost the performance (page speed) of website.

## What you can build next???

You can building your own large e-commerce site, SaaS application, or personal blog. Static website has fast page load speed, cheap hosting as it can host in CDN.
