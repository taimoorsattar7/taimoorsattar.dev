The static website generates the content on the browser without any modification/processing as it's already pre-rendered (backed). The static website is coined from the name, JAMstack.

JAM stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. JAMstack is the modern way for website development by providing a simpler developer experience, better performance, lower cost, and greater scalability. With Jamstack, youâ€™re building a large e-commerce site, SaaS application, or personal blog.

The benefits of the JAMstack website is listed below:

In past, websites are deployed in a monolithic fashion. Let's take an example of WordPress. WordPress was the most popular platform to deploy websites and manage content with CMS. But each of the services e.g. front-end, back-end, or CMS are bound to a single system. If the system is down, every service will be down. The monolithic approach has some drawbacks as below:

Slow website performance due to the size of the application
Difficult to find bugs in the system as we have to traverse each and every service.
To tackle this problem, the website deployed in a micro-service fashion. In a microservice architecture, each service has its own system. For example, the front-end has its own system, the same as the database and back-end. If any of the systems are down, we can easily find the bug.
