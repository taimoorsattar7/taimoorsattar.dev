Break the word `JAMstack` as **JAM**, **stack**. JAM means javascript, API, and markup. JAMstack is the modern way to application development. I wrote detailed ebook for building the infrastructure of JAMstack site. Link below.

- [How To Build JAMstack Site](https://taimoorsattar.dev/books/how-to-build-JAMstack-site)

We have defined the `JAM` word. Now we will dive into `stack`. In simple words, there are different ways to run an application. Same like, If you want to visit a nearby museum, you can choose different routes to arrive at the destination. **Routes can be short or long.** Same is the concept of a stack.

The other most common stack for application development are:

- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) - WordPress Architecture
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

JAMstack is a more modern way of writing applications. For building JAMstack infracture, we can divide it into two (2) sections:

| Sr#  | Sections              |                                                          Description                                                           |

| 1.   | Static Site Generator |         It consists of a raw HTML webpage (front-end) that load the same data/webpage irrespective of the user input.          |
| 2.   | Headless CMS          | Headless CMS is decoupled from the front-end, for managing content. It provide an API to query the content into the front-end. |

You can find the list of static site generators for JAMstack on [staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com).
