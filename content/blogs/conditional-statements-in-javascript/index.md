Conditional Statements execute certain operations based on logic. In Javascript, we can execute the conditional statements in three (3) ways as below:

* ternary operator
* if / else logic
* switch statement

let suppose, we have a variable in Javascript as below:

```javascript
let isMember = true;
```

We can perform condition statements in javascript as below:

**ternary operator**:

```javascript
// ternary operator
let price= isMember ? '$2.00' : '$10.00'
```

**if / else logic**:

```javascript
// if / else logic
if(isMember){
  price = '$2.00'
}else{
  price = '$10.00'
}
```

**switch statement**:

```javascript
// switch statement
switch(isMember) {
  case true:
    price = '$2.00';
    break;
  case y:
    price = '$10.00'
    break;
  default:
    price = '$2.00';
}
```
