There are tons of resources on the internet where you can find and create photos and videos for your content. I have mentioned some of the recommended sites to find assets for yourself.

1. [undraw.co](https://undraw.co)
Here you can browse illustration in SVG or PNG format to use.

2. [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)
This tool is really a handful when you are sketching your workflow. 

3. [iconfinder.com](https://www.iconfinder.com)
I recommend this place to find your SVG icons for your content.

4. [freepik.com](https://www.freepik.com)
Here you can find graphics, Vectors, Stock Photos, PSD and Icons, etc.

5. [draw.io](https://draw.io)
This is also similar to [undraw.co](https://undraw.co), but you can find different kinds of layout and options. This is also a great tool to sketch your workflow.

6. [canva.com](https://www.canva.com)
Here you can find a pre-defined design template that you can edit based on your need.
