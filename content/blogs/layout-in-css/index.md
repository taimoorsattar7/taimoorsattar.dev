Layout in CSS makes your content sit in a row or column. A Flexible layout helps to fit more content in less space.



Below are the ways in CSS to make the flexible layout in CSS:


- Table (Not Recommended)
- Floats
- Flexbox
- Grid

We can use any technique as discussed above to create any kind of layout (either 1-dimension or 2 dimensions).



For a 2-dimensional layout, we can prefer a CSS grid to make our code small. But not every browser supports a CSS grid. We can search for browser compatibility at [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com).
