Break the word `JAMstack` as **JAM**, **stack**. JAM means javascript, API, and markup. JAMstack is the modern way to application development.

We have defined the `JAM` word. Now we will dive into `stack`. In simple words, there are different ways to run an application. Same like, If you want to visit a nearby museum, you can choose different routes to arrive at the destination. **Routes can be short or long.** Same is the concept of a stack.

The other most common stack for application development are:

- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) - WordPress Architecture
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

JAMstack is a more modern way of writing applications. You can find the list of static site generators for JAMstack on [staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com).
