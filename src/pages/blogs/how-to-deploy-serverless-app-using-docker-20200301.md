## What is serverless?

Serverless is actually hosting your app on your server but on others server of big companies. We can not file dynamic database in serverless and host static app on it. 

Technology changes day by day. Before Docker came, there was a wide whisper of **virtualization**. But after docker come people are using this concept. Now, Serverless is a hot topic nowadays.

I really like the concept of docker but execution it on the production require **cost** and **time**. For this experiment, I have run a **WordPress website** with minimum resources on a cloud platform. Cost required to run this website was nearly 300$/year that's too much as compared to what is provided by other platforms.

If you run your website serverless, your speed will increase 6x and the cost will also decrease. So what is serverless that makes it stands out from docker. In serverless, you just run a static website **.html** on the static page hosting provider. There are 3 stages involved

* Data source
* Build
* Deploy of static hosting platform
