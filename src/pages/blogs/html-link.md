HTML Link in the website is used to navigates from page to page. We can define an attribute on the HTML link to make it more meaningful. The Search engine e.g. Google crawls the website to get information from the links on the website.

In simple, we define the link attribute in HTML as below:

```html
<a href="https://taimoorsattar.dev">Text Area</a>
```

Above, we have defined one(1) attribute to the HTML link, **href**. The **href** is an important attribute of the link that tells where to navigate when the link is clicked.


```html
<a href="mailto:taimoorsattar7@gmail.com">Email Me</a>
```

Below are listed attributes that you can define in the HTML link.



 

**rel="nofollow"** will be treated as a hint rather than a strong signal (starting March 1, 2020)
**rel="sponsored"** is a new link attribute to highlight sponsored and affiliate links (Google already supports it)
**rel="usg"** is a new link attribute to highlight links in the user generated content (Google already supports it)
