To learn about web development in 2021, you have to understand what makes up the websites. In the blog, we cover the core things to kickstart your career as a web developer in 2021.

## Start from the basics

If you want to learn website development, start from the basics. Before you run, you have to learn how to walk. The basic ingredient of website development is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is the structure layout of the website. For example, heading, paragraph, sidebar, etc.

CSS used to style the HTML content of the website. CSS adds styles to the content like color, margin, padding, typography, etc.

JavaScript is used to add dynamic content to the website without refreshing the page. For example, open and close menu-content items, popup modal, etc.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the front end of the website that's **web browser can understand**. We can manipulate and change the property/logic of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the browser using the inspect tool. So, if you are making a website that needs bank account validation, it's not a good idea to serve all of your logic on the front-end.

## Connecting with the backend/database

Backend language runs on the server, not on the browser. NodeJS, PHP, etc are some programming languages that run on the servers. The server could be accessed by administrators, not the public. We can validate/perform the logical operation on the server.

Backend is where you can perform the logical operation to CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) into the database. The type of database you can learn is SQL and non-SQL database.

SQL database is table-based while the non-sql database is documentation-based (key-value). Some of the SQL databases are:

- MYSQL
- PostgreSQL

Some of the NON-SQL databases on the internet are:

- MongoDB
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

We use the database to store, retrieve, and manipulate the data on the server e,g. store login credential.

## Contribute to open source projects

Taking an online course helps to learn the fundamental concepts of website development. After, you can follow up with the open-source projects on the internet. Contributing to the open-source project helps you to learn the technique to solve problems in a more convenient way.

You can search for the open-source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com) and start to contribute.

## Learn the Framework

The framework makes it easy for the developer to start making websites as it has set up initial configuration settings.

The modern framework like [NextJs](https://nextjs.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) help you to kick start with your project.

## Hosting project on the public server

To share your local project with the public, you need to host it on the hosting provider. There are different hosting providers on the internet. Some of them are listed below:

- [netlify](https://www.netlify.com)
- [vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

There are different architectures in which to host your website on the public server. You may choose monolithic or microservices architecture to host your website. There main difference between the two architectures is that where you want all of your application services in one place(server) or host service in a different place (server). You can host your front-end application service on one server and back-end service on another server.
