Markdown is the light weight, plain text language that you can use to add formatting to your document. The best part of markdown is that you don't need to download any thing; just plain text editor is enough. Using Markdown, we can convert text to HTML without requiring the skills of HTML and CSS. Rich text **WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)** is used in same terminology as markdown but in different method. Markdown is clean and simple to look in simple plain text.

## How it works?

Markdown is generally written in file that has extension of `.md` or `.markdown` extension. In order for makedown to display on the browser, you have to process the markdown to HTML; a simple script or markdown processor can do the trick. 


Here are some Markdown document applications that are by default present on your system:

- Mac: MacDown, iA Writer, or Marked
- iOS / Android: iA Writer
- Windows: ghostwriter or Markdown Monster
- Linux: ReText or ghostwriter
- Web: Gitbook, Dillinger or StackEdit


## Overview of Rich Editor (WYSIWYG)

In WYSIWYG, you will be provided a bar where you can choose styles for the text.  Some of the styles of the text include bold, italics, bullets, etc. Google Docs / Microsoft Word are the most popular rich editor for creating content.


For me, I prefer to write in markdown rather than WYSIWYG. In WYSIWYG, it is hard to look for the HTML tags that are applied on the text.
