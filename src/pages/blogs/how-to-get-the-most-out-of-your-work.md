Let's explain this to you by a story.

> A person was working hard continuously for the morning. Someone asked him what are you doing. He replied I have been cutting the wood for about 6 hours and stills not cut down the tree as I was expecting. He replied have you ever take time to sharp you saw. He replied no.

## Plan before action

Now that's where he failed if he takes a break and sharpens his saw he would get more in quick time. Therefore plan your action. Developing an action plan can help you to turn your visions into reality, and increase efficiency.

## Learn from your mistake

**Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from poor judgment.** Everybody does the mistake but if you don't learn from the mistake you will be in losing again. To avoid doing a mistake, create A list of reasons for the mistake you have done on the day and try to avoid these mistakes in the coming days. Ask yourself what are those things that cause the mistake and make a proper plan to eliminate those mistake

> Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.

## Break the task into chunks

**Break large tasks down into smaller chunks, more manageable pieces.** Break down a project that is complicated or time-consuming can make it tough to start, but if you can break it down into more manageable chunks, you may find it easier to do so.

## Choose a dedicated workspace

**Choose the dedicated workspace that is free from distraction and is more work-friendly.** For example, If you operate an automotive paint shop, then chances are your workspace will be the garage. Setting up a dedicated workspace is critical because it helps to [get the job done](https://www.underlinejobs.com/) in a more productive environment.

## Don't be lazy

**If you start lazy, you will end lazy.** If you make a lazy timetable, you will not perform well in the work. Avoid making a timetable that involves multitasking work. Make a time table that will avoid you to do multitasking work and to do more productive work.

## Be accountable

Whether it’s weekly check-ins with a co-worker or setting your own deadlines and announcing them to others, having to answer to someone else can often force you to get the job done.
